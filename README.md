# Classic Inventory System for Unity

A inventory system similar to others in games like terraria, Minecraft or Valheim. You have X ammount of slots and in each slot you can have X ammount of an item. It's also possible to move X ammount to the cursor or to another slot, or remove items in the trash \
It can also be used to create containers like inventories for looteable boxes etc... \
It comes with a demo and it's easy to use and/or modify. \
Uses the new input system, but if the old one is preferred it's very easy to change. \
